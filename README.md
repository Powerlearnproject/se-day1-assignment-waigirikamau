#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of  designing, developing and maintaining software. Its importance in the technology industry includes:
i) Cyber Security- secure software development methodology are critical in defending against cyber threats
ii) Artificial intelligence- AI systems require sofware engineering practices to handle complex data processing and algorithms.
iii) Mobile App development- software engineering ensures high quality mobile applications with seamless user interface and smooth performance.
iv) Clowd Computing- software enginneering helps in building and managing scalable cloud infrastructure
v) in health care sector software engineering helps in patient management systems, telemedicines and data analysis

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i) Software crisis- in the 1960s  the complexity of sofware systems grew significantly as the early methods of software development became inefficient. there was a growing recognition of the need for formal methods, better tools and structured approches to sofware developemt.
ii) structured programming- in the 1970s there was emphasis of breaking down programs into smaller manageable modules with clear functions. C-program language was widely adopted language promoting structured programming concepts.
iii)object oriented programming- in 1980s it became a major paradigm with languages like c++. this evolution era emphasized and focused on data encapsulation and inheritance leading to reusable codes and improved maintainability.
iv) internet era - in 1990s there was a web development(HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT). This helped in building interactive web applications. also, there was distributed computing model for web applications known as client server architecture

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i)planning - this involves gathering requirement from customers and documenting them.
ii) Design - this involves creating a bluprint for the software, including user interfaces, system interfaces and data bases
iii) Testing - involves testing the software to ensure it meets requirements and functions properly
iv) deployment- involves moving the software from the testing environment to the operating environment
v) Maintenance - involves monitoring the application for issues that arise once it is in production


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Differences:
i) Process Flow- waterfall progresses through phases while agile works in short cycles
ii) Flexibilty- waterfall is less adaptable to chnages due to its rigid structure while agile actively encourages adjustments based on feedback received through development process
iii) Customer involvement- in waterfall, customer feedback is primarily gatghered at the beginning while agile emphasizes ongoing collaboration with the customer throughout the project
iv) Documentation- waterfall requires extensive upfront while agile focuses on delivering working software with less detailed documentation

Similarities
i) Both approaches are centered around goals. They ensure delivery of topnotch software products that meet or exceed customer expectations.
ii) Development phases- both agile and waterfall share development phase which include planning, designing, developing, testing and deployment.
iii) Quality focus- testing is the lead quality feature for both agile and waterfall approaches.

Scenarios
Waterfall Example
Building a simmple web application with clearly defined features and fuctionalities for a client with well established requirement.

Agile Example
Developing a new mobile app for a start up where market needs are constantly envolving and customer feedback is vital for direction.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Importance of IDEs:
Code editing automation
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.

Intelligent code completion
Various search terms show up when you start typing words in a search engine. Similarly, an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.

Refactoring support
Code refactoring is the process of restructuring the source code to make it more efficient and readable without changing its core functionality. IDEs can auto-refactor to some extent, allowing developers to improve their code quickly and easily. Other team members understand readable code faster, which supports collaboration within the team.

Local build automation
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.

Compilation
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.

Testing
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.

Example of an IDE
Visual studio- it offers features like autocompletion built-in Git support, debugging and testing intergration all within a single platform.

Importance of version control systems
Code Consistency: 
With version control systems, developers can maintain a consistent codebase. Every change made to the code is stored in the system, ensuring that the entire team is working on the same version. This eliminates the hassle of dealing with multiple copies and allows for efficient collaboration.
Collaboration: 
VCS significantly simplifies collaboration among developers. Multiple team members can work on the same project simultaneously, and any modifications are automatically synced with the central repository. This facilitates seamless teamwork and minimizes conflicts that arise from working on shared codebases.
Error Recovery: 
VCS provides a safety net for developers by offering the ability to revert to previous versions of the code. If a mistake is made or a bug is introduced, developers can easily roll back to a known working state. This saves valuable time and ensures that the project remains on track.
Record Keeping: 
Version control systems maintain a detailed history of changes made to the codebase. Each commit is documented, including the author, timestamp, and a description of the modifications. This audit trail is invaluable for understanding the evolution of the code and for identifying the root cause of issues.

Example of Version Control System 
Github is built on Git, it allows developers to store code in repository, track changes and collaborate. Developers can review codes before merging it into the main branch.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Common Challenges:
Keeping up with technology:
New frameworks, languages, and tools emerge frequently, requiring constant learning and adaptation. 
Complex debugging:
Identifying and fixing errors in large codebases can be time-consuming and challenging. 
Collaboration issues:
Miscommunication between team members, designers, and product managers can hinder progress. 
Security vulnerabilities:
Designing secure software requires considering potential threats at every stage of development. 
Changing requirements:
Clients may modify project needs mid-development, impacting project timelines. 
Technical debt:
Accumulating code that is difficult to maintain can lead to long-term issues. 

Strategies to Overcome Challenges:
Continuous learning:
Regularly attend workshops, read industry blogs, and participate in online communities to stay updated on new technologies. 
Clear communication:
Establish open communication channels with clients, stakeholders, and team members to ensure everyone understands requirements. 
Agile methodologies:
Employ flexible development approaches like Scrum or Kanban to adapt to changing requirements and prioritize tasks effectively. 
Robust testing practices:
Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and user acceptance testing to identify and address bugs early. 
Code reviews:
Have peers review code to catch potential errors, maintain code quality, and share knowledge. 
Security by design:
Integrate security considerations into the design phase, including data encryption and user authentication. 
Project management tools:
Utilize tools for task tracking, issue management, and collaboration to streamline the development process. 
Time management:

Team building:
Foster a collaborative environment where team members feel comfortable sharing ideas and supporting each other. 
Skill development:
Invest in training programs to improve problem-solving skills, design thinking, and technical expertise. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing 
Tests individual software components in isolation
Ensures each unit's functionality and behavior is correct
Most useful during development to find and fix defects early
Integration testing 
Combines all units within a program and tests them as a group
Finds interface defects between modules or functions
Determines how efficiently units run together
System testing 
Tests the final software product in relation to the computer system it's part of
Ensures the product works properly with all of the software and hardware systems it interfaces with
Acceptance testing 
Assesses whether the final software is ready for delivery
Ensures the product meets the end user's needs and complies with all of the original business criteria


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of carefully crafting input instructions, called "prompts," to guide an AI model towards generating the desired output, essentially acting as a way to control and optimize the behavior of an AI system by providing specific and detailed information to ensure accurate and relevant responses.

Importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models.
Impact on output:
Well-designed prompts can significantly improve the quality, accuracy, and relevance of an AI model's response. 
Context:
Providing relevant context within the prompt helps the AI understand the situation and generate more appropriate answers. 
Creative aspect:
Prompt engineering can involve creativity and experimentation to find the best way to phrase a prompt for a specific task. 
Technical considerations:
Understanding the capabilities and limitations of the AI model is important for crafting effective prompts. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:

"Tell me about climate change."

Improved Prompt:

"Explain the main causes of climate change and their impact on global temperatures in the last 50 years, citing relevant scientific studies."


Explanation of the Improved Prompt:
1. Clarity:
The improved prompt specifies exactly what the user wants to know: the main causes of climate change and their impact on global temperatures. This removes any ambiguity about the subject and focuses the AI on key aspects.
2. Specificity:
By mentioning the time frame (last 50 years) and requesting scientific studies, the prompt narrows the scope, guiding the AI to provide more targeted information, rather than a general or broad overview of climate change.
3. Conciseness:
While more specific, the improved prompt is still concise and to the point, focusing on essential details without unnecessary information or overcomplication.
